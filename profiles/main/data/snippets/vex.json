	// Place your snippets for vex here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Print to console": {
		"prefix": "printf",
		"body": [
			"printf(\"%s \\n\", $1);",
		],
		"description": "Log output to console"
	},
	"///": {
		"prefix": "///",
		"body": [
			"// ================================ $0 ================================",
		],
		"description": "注释标题"
	}
